The plan for the project is to pull in Pull Request data over a user specified length of time and then make a connected graph of it.

The UI of the graph would be circles based on module with sizes related to number of commits in that node made during the specified time period

The next stage would be to allow the nodes to be expanded further and further until you get to the individual file level for a given module

at this level, nodes be linked out to the PR they are representing

I think some way to also correlate time might be useful but as I'm envisioning the graph currently I'm really not sure how to implement that.

Look into git-log-to-json so we can get file locations and such wrapped up into JSON attributes. From there I can start toying with ways to arrange the actual graph nodes, not sure how doable that is in base d3

So the current tutorial seems to be a bit closer to what I actually want to do (force directed graph of some sort) 
Currently still having some trouble pulling in the data, might need to modify my function for pullng the data again but that's something I can look into more tomorrow
